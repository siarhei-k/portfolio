The HR Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI interactive tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into various key metrics related to human resources within an organization. The purpose of this dashboard is to aid in strategic decision-making and to improve understanding of workforce trends and patterns.

Key features of this dashboard include:
 
1. **General Employee Data:** This feature will provide a broad overview of the entire workforce. This includes data on total employee count, attrition rate, gender ratio, active employees, and job roles distribution. This general data will provide a bird's eye view of the organization's employee composition and can be used for overall HR planning and management.

2. **Age-wise Employee Distribution:** This provides a snapshot of the age distribution of employees within the organization, segmented into different age bands. This helps understand the age demographics of the company's workforce.

3. **Employee Attrition Data:** A critical aspect of the dashboard is providing a clear visual representation of attrition across different age groups. This can help to identify any trends or patterns in staff turnover, enabling management to take proactive steps to improve retention rates.

4. **Education Level Slicer:** This feature allows the user to filter data based on the education level of the employees. By doing this, users can analyze the impact of education levels on various HR metrics, which can aid in strategic decision-making.
